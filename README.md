## Introduction and Overview
Hi, I'm Cuppixx, a passionate hobbyist game developer and IT/software student with a focus on game design, development, and software engineering. My expertise spans across multiple technologies, including GDScript, C++, Python, C#, Rust, Java, SQL and more, and I have hands-on experience with game engines such as Godot, Unreal, Unity, and Bevy.
I also have foundational knowledge in the fields of networking, internet applications, distributed systems, and IT security.

I love turning ideas into interactive, polished experiences and thrive in environments that challenge my creativity and problem-solving skills.

## Project: KoalaTime_Take-A-Break
**Date:** _March 14th 2024 - May 19th 2024_

**Project Type:** _Personal, Professional_

**Project Category:** _Asset_

**Technologies Used:**  
`Godot Engine`, `GDScript`

##### Overview

_KoalaTime is an asset I originally developed for personal use and later published to the Godot Asset Store. The asset allows users to set up a work/break timer that reminds them to take a break after a specified period. My goal was to improve my workflow by incorporating small breaks to recharge during work sessions. The project was purposefully kept minimalistic to maintain simplicity and a visually clean design. The asset includes sounds, images, and a few customization options, such as displaying your own images during break time._

##### Key Contributions

- _Solo development._

##### Challenges & Solutions

- _None._

The project itself wasn't what I would consider difficult; there were no challenges that caused me to get stuck during development. However, a few notable features, while not challenging, were interesting to implement. One of these was a recursive algorithm that searches through the projectâ€™s file structure to collect any images the user has provided, allowing for a highly flexible file structure. No matter how complex or nested, it will return every image. This project was also my very first Godot asset/addon, but thanks to the documentation and my general understanding of how Godot assets work, it served as an easy and smooth introduction to Godot development.

##### Results & Impact

- _As of October 2024, the project has received a total of 3 stars on GitHub._
- _Throughout its development the project has had over 300 unique visitors, according to GitHub's traffic tool._
- _After the last commit, the project had an averaged 1 to 2 unique visitors every two weeks, again based on data from GitHub's traffic tool._
- _Feedback from various Twitch users in the Software and Game Development category has been positive. They noted that the plugin looks visually clean and professional. The overall concept was well received, and several streamers mentioned they enjoy using it._

## Project: PandaTime_Take-A-Break
**Date:** _March 14th 2024 - August 4th 2024_

**Project Type:** _Personal, Professional_

**Project Category:** _Asset_

**Technologies Used:**  
`Godot Engine`, `GDScript`

##### Overview

_PandaTime is an asset I originally developed for personal use and later published to the Godot Asset Store. The asset allows users to set up a work/break timer that reminds them to take a break after a specified period. My goal was to improve my workflow by incorporating small breaks to recharge during work sessions. The project was designed with a visually clean design in mind and features a dedicated settings window. The asset includes sounds, images, and a lot of customization options._

_The asset is a more feature and settings heavy version of the above KoalaTime._

##### Key Contributions

- _Solo development._

##### Challenges & Solutions

- _Communication between various isolated, separate window instances._
  - _This was solved by setting up a signal connection during instantiation, before adding the instance to the scene tree. I also connected to the window's internal signals from the outside to obtain information about the window state, using those informations to exchange data before a node is freed from the scene tree._

##### Results & Impact

- _As of October 2024, the project has no stars on GitHub._
- _Throughout its development the project has had over 150 unique visitors, according to GitHub's traffic tool._
- _After the last commit, the project had an averaged 0 to 1 unique visitors every two weeks, again based on data from GitHub's traffic tool._
- _Feedback from 2 Twitch users in the Software and Game Development category has been positive. They noted that the plugin looks visually clean and professional. The overall concept was well received._
- _Users were pleased with the extensive customization options available and had no further requests for feature implementation._
