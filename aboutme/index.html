                    <p>
                        The name's David — or Cuppixx, whichever you prefer. I'm a 24-year-old hobbyist game and junior full-stack developer currently living in Germany.
                        I originally wanted to become an early childhood educator, but then decided to dive into IT and software development — and it's been one wild ride ever since.
                        Whenever I learn something new, it gets me fired up, and every new field I explore draws me in, offering so many things to learn and do.
                        It's the same thrill I usually only get from reading — finding a new book each week that I can't wait to dive into.

                    <h3>About my Education:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Like most people — and quite unremarkably so — I attended Kindergarten and elementary school before being recommended to a Gymnasium, an accelerated college-preparatory high school.
                        In high school, we were placed in the G8 (8-year Gymnasium) program (a school reform between 2012 and 2015),
                        allowing us to earn the Abitur in 12th grade and our lower secondary certificate after 9th instead of 10th grade, effectively speeding high school up by one year.

                        In 9th grade, a career-oriented internship at a nursery school led me to enroll in vocational training for early childhood education at August-Vetter-Berufskolleg.
                        Since this training required a higher qualification, I decided to complete a Vocational Baccalaureate in Social & Health Care at the same school,
                        which included a one-year nursery internship. I then pursued the three-year early childhood education program,
                        including shorter internships in the first two years and a final Anerkennungsjahr — a one-year internship of sorts.
                        Although I enjoyed my internships, I found the job's social demands exhausting and unable to fully dedicate myself to the children, decided not to continue.

                        After exploring other fields, I completed a computer science internship at d.velop AG in Bocholt in summer 2022,
                        where I learned about programming languages, IT, and software development for the first time using Visual Studio and C#.
                        Later that year, I enrolled at the WHS Bocholt, a University of Applied Sciences.
                        I had originally planned to start in 2023, but the dean offered me a spot for Winter Semester 2022 based on my Vocational Baccalaureate marks and
                        an available slot — even though the semester had already begun.
                        The first two semesters were overwhelming, as my last exposure to math and physics was in 9th grade and my programming experience was still limited.

                        By the third semester, I was scoring top marks in most subjects and started to delve into game development in my free time.
                        I finished my Bachelor's degree at the end of 2025 with a final grade of 1.7 (equivalent to an A-/B+ in the US or a high 2:1 in the UK) and an average grade of 1.9 across all courses.
                    </p>

                    <h3>More to read</h3>
                    <p>
                        I could easily spend hours discussing my favorite books and games — topics I'm truly passionate about.
                        However, I realize that not everyone shares this interest. So, instead, I'd like to share some of my future plans and ideas — projects I've always wanted to start or complete,
                        regardless of my field of work, because they keep grapping my interest time and time again.
                    </p>

                    <p style="margin-top: 7px;">
                        As a hobbyist game developer, one of my dreams is to create my "dream" game. It's a common aspiration among developers, and while such projects often take years
                        to complete — especially when pursued alongside other commitments — I'm still determined to start working on it once I have finished my studies and have more freetime to dedicate to it.
                        Additionally, I would love to develop more reusable gamedev assets.
                        This way, I can use them in my own, future projects and make them available as open-source for others to benefit from.
                        I enjoy exploring assets created by others, and if I can contribute something valuable — even if similar tools might already exist elsewhere —
                        offering my version could be a cool way to give back to the game development community.
                        It's often said, somewhat meme-ish, that one of our greatest assets as programmers is to steal other people's code, or a bit less cynical:
                        our ability to utilize and integrate code developed by others, making our lives easier and our projects more efficient. And quite honestly,
                        I'm not opposed to the idea of other people "stealing" my open-source code and therefore being able to help other people with their projects through my code and work.
                        Beyond game development, I'm also interested in exploring non-game-related projects in my free time.
                        I'd like to create web-based and mobile applications, set up my own smart home, dabble more in Generative AI, and possibly program my own robot.
                        And who knows? Perhaps someone else will find these projects interesting too.
                    </p>
