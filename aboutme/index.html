                    <p>
                        The name's David (or Cuppixx, whichever you prefer). I'm a 23-year-old hobbyist game developer living in Germany.
                        I'm currently studying IT Software Systems.
                        I originally wanted to become an early childhood educator, but then decided to dive into IT and software development — and it's been one wild ride ever since.
                        Whenever I learn something new, it gets me fired up, and every new field I explore draws me in, offering so many things to learn and do.
                        It's the same thrill I usually only get from reading — finding a new book each week that I can't wait to dive into.

                    <h3>About my Education:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Like most people — and very unnotably — I attended Kindergarten and elementary school. 
                        After that, I was recommended to attend a Gymnasium, an accelerated college-preparatory high school.
                        <br>
                        When enrolling in high school, we were automatically placed in the G8 program, a school reform between 2012 and 2015.
                        G8 (8-year Gymnasium) meant that instead of earning the Abitur after the 13th grade, students could now graduate after the 12th.
                        This also shifted all other leaving certificates down by a year, allowing students to earn their lower secondary school certificate after 9th grade instead of 10th.
                        In 9th grade, we had a one-week internship to explore career options.
                        I chose to intern at a nursery school, which I enjoyed, and later enrolled in vocational training for early childhood education at August-Vetter-Berufskolleg.
                        <br>
                        Since vocational training required a higher qualification, I first completed a Vocational Baccalaureate in Social & Health Care at the same school,
                        which included a one-year nursery school internship and a year of full-time schooling.
                        After completing my Vocational Baccalaureate, I began training in early childhood education.
                        The three-year program included shorter internships in the first two years and a final Anerkennungsjahr — a one-year internship with full responsibilities.
                        Through these internships, I worked at various nursery schools and kindergartens.
                        While I enjoyed my one-year internship (thanks to my colleagues), I found the job's social demands too exhausting.
                        Unable to fully dedicate myself to the children, I decided not to continue down this path.
                        Unsure of my next steps, I spent some time exploring different fields.
                        <br>
                        In the summer of 2022, I completed a computer science internship at d.velop AG in Bocholt, mainly to explore IT, thinking, "I like playing games, so let's see what this is about."
                        I took my first steps in programming, learning about programming languages, IT, and software development.
                        I quickly became fascinated by the field and even worked on graphical designs for the company's in-house software using Visual Studio and C#.
                        Later that year, I enrolled in a University of Applied Sciences. I had originally planned to start in the Winter Semester of 2023/24,
                        but after a call with the dean, he offered me a spot for Winter Semester 2022/23, considering my Vocational Baccalaureate marks and an open slot,
                        even though the semester had already begun.
                        The first two semesters were tough.
                        Since math and physics weren't part of my vocational school curriculum, my last exposure was in 9th grade. With no preparation, I scrambled through the courses.
                        On top of that, my only programming experience was a short internship, so jumping straight into C and C++ was quite overwhelming.
                        <br>
                        Once I got the hang of things, I started enjoying the course more.
                        By the third semester, I was scoring top marks in all subjects and diving into game development in my free time.
                        Now, I'm in my final semester, preparing for my bachelor's thesis.
