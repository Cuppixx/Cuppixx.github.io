                    <p>
                        The name's David (or Cuppixx, whichever you prefer). I'm a 23-year-old hobbyist game developer living in Germany.
                        I'm currently studying IT Software Systems.
                        I originally wanted to become an early childhood educator, but then decided to dive into IT and software development — and it's been one wild ride ever since.
                        Whenever I learn something new, it gets me fired up, and every new field I explore draws me in, offering so many things to learn and do.
                        It's the same thrill I usually only get from reading — finding a new book each week that I can't wait to dive into.

                    <h3>About my Education:</h3>
                    <p>
                        Like most people — and unremarkably so — I attended Kindergarten and elementary school before being recommended to a Gymnasium, an accelerated college-preparatory high school.
                        In high school, we were placed in the G8 (8-year Gymnasium) program (a school reform between 2012 and 2015),
                        allowing us to earn the Abitur in 12th grade and our lower secondary certificate after 9th grade instead of 10th grade, effectively speeding high school up by one year.
                        In 9th grade, a career-oriented internship at a nursery school led me to enroll in vocational training for early childhood education at August-Vetter-Berufskolleg.
                        Since this training required a higher qualification, I decided to complete a Vocational Baccalaureate in Social & Health Care at the same school,
                        which included a one-year nursery internship. I then pursued the three-year early childhood education program,
                        including shorter internships in the first two years and a final Anerkennungsjahr — a one-year internship with full responsibilities.
                        Although I enjoyed my internships, I found the job's social demands exhausting and unable to fully dedicate myself to the children, decided not to continue.
                        After exploring other fields, I completed a computer science internship at d.velop AG in Bocholt in summer 2022,
                        where I learned about programming languages, IT, and software development for the first time using Visual Studio and C#.
                        Later that year, I enrolled at the WHS Bocholt, a University of Applied Sciences.
                        I had originally planned to start in Winter Semester 2023/24, but the dean offered me a spot for Winter Semester 2022/23 based on my Vocational Baccalaureate marks and
                        an available slot — even though the semester had already begun.
                        The first two semesters were challenging, as my last exposure to math and physics was in 9th grade and my programming experience was limited, making C and C++ overwhelming.
                        By the third semester, however, I excelled in my courses and delved into game development in my free time. I am now in my final semester, preparing for my bachelor's thesis.
